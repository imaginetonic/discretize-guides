<Warning>

This build is very common in PuGs. It is part of a composition called PuG Meta. More info about this composition can be found [here](/guides/meta-explained). This build provides a high amount of boons and a lot of safety to the group via its healing. It therefore shines most in less experienced groups as well as when you have bad instabilities.

</Warning>

It also has access to a small amount of <Boon name="Aegis" />, <Boon name="Stability" /> througt <Skill id="63293"/>.

It offers a large of healing thanks to <Skill name="Med Kit"/>, <Skill name="Super Elixir"/>, permanent <Boon name="Regeneration"/> and <Boon name="Vigor"/> that you get from <Skill name="Energizing Slam"/>. Whenever you use a Jade Golem skill it pumps out as well a small amount of healing when traited with <Trait name="Soothing Detonation"/>.

Note that this build variant is optimized for 150 agony resistance. If you have more Agony Resistance, feel free to swap out more Harrier pieces but make sure you are maintaining as close to 100% <Attribute name="boon duration"/> as possible.

Activating a Tome will replace your weapon skills and grant you 5 skill usages in the Tome. You can also leave the Tome early though.

Entering a Tome has a cast time and your Skill 5 on both weapon sets can cancel skill casts so make sure to not spam the 5 button when entering the Tome or you might end up cancelling the Tome.

Tomes also have the passive effect from the Virtues. Through <Trait name="Loremaster"/> those passive effects will be kept even if the Tomes are on cooldown.

<Skill name="Crash Down" text="Jade Mech"/>:

- <TomeSkill name="Chapter 4: Scorched Aftermath"/> creates a Fire Field that can be used to blast <Boon name="Might"/>.
- <TomeSkill name="Epilogue: Ashes of the Just"/> grants an effect to allies that makes them inflict burning on their next attacks. This scales with <Attribute name="Condition Damage"/> so be careful when using this skill or skip it entirely when running with <Specialization name="Firebrand" text="Condi Firebrands"/>.
- When running Radiance, dealing damage with any skill in this Tome will trigger <Trait name="Wrath of Justice"/> and share the <Attribute name="Condition Damage"/> to allies through <Trait name="Perfect Inscriptions"/>.
- When running Radiance killing certain enemies will lower the cooldown on this Tome. Keep in mind this will not reset the skills in the Tome.
- A common rotation in this Tome is 4-(5)-exit.

<Skill name="Med Kit" />:

- A common rotation in this Tome is 4-(5)-exit.

<Skill name="Elixir Gun" />:

- Use this Tome for emergency healing and cleansing.
- <TomeSkill name="Chapter 1: Desert Bloom"/> heals in a cone in front of you.
- <TomeSkill name="Chapter 2: Radiant Recovery"/> heals and cleanses conditions.
- <TomeSkill name="Chapter 3: Azure Sun"/> gives some boons but will rarely be used.
- <TomeSkill name="Chapter 4: Shining River"/> places a healing field that can also be blasted for extra healing.
- <TomeSkill name="Epilogue: Eternal Oasis"/> converts conditions into boons and grants allies an incoming healing modifier.
- When running Virtues entering this Tome also cleanses conditions.
- Common rotations in this Tome are 2-5-4-1-2 for maximum sustained healing or 5-4-2-1-1 for maximum burst healing.

<Skill name="Elite Mortar Kit"/>:

- Use this Tome for massive <Boon name="Stability"/>, <Boon name="Resistance"/> or a reflect.
- <TomeSkill name="Chapter 1: Unflinching Charge"/> grants <Boon name="Stability"/>.
- <TomeSkill name="Chapter 2: Daring Challenge"/> inflicts 1 second of <Condition name="Taunt"/> on the enemy which is a 75/s soft CC.
- <TomeSkill name="Chapter 3: Valiant Bulwark"/> places a bubble that reflects incoming projectiles.
- <TomeSkill name="Chapter 4: Stalwart Stand"/> places a field that pulses <Boon name="Resistance"/> to allies. This will help dealing with non-damaging conditions such as <Condition name="Blinded"/> and <Condition name="Slow"/>.
- <TomeSkill name="Epilogue: Unbroken Lines"/> provides <Boon name="Protection"/>, <Boon name="Aegis"/>, <Boon name="Stability"/> as well as extra Toughness.
- There is no set rotation in this Tome, use whatever skills you need for their utility and make sure to press Skill 5 as it is an incredibly strong skill.
- You can camp in this Tome for a few extra seconds to get an extra cast on an important skill, for example a 2nd reflect. However only do this when absolutely needed as you will not have access to the boons and healing your weapon skills provide.

</Card>

<Divider text="Providing Boons"/>

<Card title="Standard Boons">

- <Boon name="Quickness" /> will be provided by using <Skill name="Mantra of Solace" /> (which
  triggers <Trait name="Liberators Vow" /> every 7 seconds algning nicely with the recharge time of the skill with Alacrity and <Trait name="Weighty Terms"/>) and <Skill name="Mantra of Potence" />. You can use <Skill name="Mantra of Potence" /> down to 0 charges whenever you are stacked with your group.
- <Boon name="Might" /> comes from different sources. <Skill name="Empower" /> is
  a big source of <Boon name="Might" /> and should be used off-cooldown whenever
  you are on Staff and on the group. Using <Skill name="Tome of Justice" /> Skill
  4 and blasting it with <Skill name="Holy Strike" /> will also grant <Boon name="Might" /> and
  give others the option to also blast additional <Boon name="Might" />. Using <Skill name="Mantra of Potence" /> as mentioned above will also contribute to <Boon name="Might" /> generation.
- <Boon name="Fury" /> will be provided through <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance" />
  . Make sure to use this off-cooldown when on the Axe weapon set while people are
  stacked together. Try to use this skill 2 times before swapping to Staff.
- <Boon name="Swiftness" /> mainly comes from <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness" />
  . Make sure to use this whenever you are on Staff.
- <Boon name="Regeneration" /> will be provided through <Skill name="Mantra of Lore" /> when
  equipped. You can keep 2 charges for condi cleanse while providing some <Boon name="Regeneration" /> whenever it goes back to 3 charges.
- Your main source of <Boon name="Protection"/> comes from <Skill name="Mantra of Solace"/>. You can use it whenever you need it for healing but make sure to use it often enough to trigger <Trait name="Liberator's Vow"/> for <Boon name="Quickness"/>. Some <Boon name="Protection"/> can be provided through <Skill name="Shield of Judgment"/>. <Skill name="Tome of Courage"/> offers some <Boon name="Protection"/> from Skill 5 as well but you do not want to use this Tome just for a small boost in <Boon name="Protection"/>.
- <Boon name="Resolution" /> is provided through <Skill name="Mantra of Solace" /> and <Skill name="Mantra of Liberation" />. If you think you will not need all 3 charges for <Boon name="Stability" />, you can use <Skill name="Mantra of Liberation" /> down to 2 charges in order to to keep up permanent <Boon name="Resolution" /> for the group alongside <Skill name="Mantra of Solace" />.

</Card>

<Card title="Pre-Stacking Boons">

- Provide a Fire Field if needed. <TomeSkill name="Chapter 4: Scorched Aftermath"/> in <Skill name="Tome of Justice"/> provides a short Fire Field. <Skill name="Hallowed Ground"/> provides a longer Fire Field as well as extra <Boon name="Resolution"/> but has to be specifically slotted for pre-stacking.
- <Skill name="Holy Strike" /> to blast <Boon name="Might" />.
- <Skill name="Empower" /> and cast every equipped Mantra as often as you can during the cast.
- <Skill name="Feel My Wrath" /> if you have it equipped.
- <Skill name="Bane Signet" /> if you can start the fight within 10 seconds of usage.
- Take the singularity.
- <Skill name="Empower" /> and use <Skill name="Mantra of Potence" /> once during
  this cast.
- <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness" /> on the way to the boss and swap to Axe before
  the fight starts to place <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance" />.

</Card>

<Divider text="Healing"/>

<Card title="Sustained Healing">

- Try to keep your group alive as well as you can through sustained healing and use your burst healing only when it is needed. Keep in mind that active damage mitigation through avoiding attacks or blocking them is very valuable and will help a lot more than a slight increase in healing numbers.
- A lot of consistent healing comes from your symbols through <Trait name="Writ of Persistence"/>. Since you want to use <Skill name="Symbol of Vengeance"/> and <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/> off-cooldown anyways to provide boons, This will give you a nice amount of healing through the entire fight. Same goes for <Skill name="Empower"/>.
- Thanks to <Trait name="Selfless Daring"/> you will also heal at the end of a dodge roll. Make sure to keep enough endurance to avoid mechanics but otherwise feel free to use up dodges for healing.
- If <Skill name="Mantra of Lore"/> is equipped, it will provide <Boon name="Regeneration"/> to your group so make sure to use it down to 2 charges whenever it goes back up to 3.
- If Mace is equipped the auto-attacks will provide a good amount of healing and <Skill name="Symbol of Faith"/> will provide extra <Boon name="Regeneration"/>.

</Card>

<Card title="Burst Healing">

- For emergency situations you have some smaller burst healing options as well
  as your <Skill name="Tome of Resolve" />.
- If you are swapping to Staff when
  healing is needed keep in mind that <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness" />
  provides healing over time while <Skill name="Holy Strike" /> and
  <Skill name="Empower" /> provide burst healing.
- <Skill name="Bow of Truth" /> is a great option for high burst healing when slotted.
- <Skill name="Tome of Resolve" /> is the biggest source of burst healing and should
  be used as a last resort due to its long cooldown. However due to the cast of both
  opening the Tome and the skills within, make sure to not hesitate too long. If
  the healing does not need to be immediate you can use 2-5-4-1-2, if you need the
  instant burst healing you can use 5-4-2-1-1.

</Card>

<Card title="Condition Cleanse">

- If a lot of condition cleanse is needed you will most likely slot <Skill name="Mantra of Lore"/> which will then be your main reliable source of condition cleanse while also providing some extra <Boon name="Regeneration"/>.
- Blasting Light Fields also causes area condition cleanse. On Staff you can place <Skill name="Symbol of Swiftness"/> and blast it with <Skill name="Holy Strike"/>.
- In <Skill name="Tome of Resolve" /> <TomeSkill name="Chapter 2: Radiant Recovery"/> and <TomeSkill name="Epilogue: Eternal Oasis"/> will cleanse conditions as well,
  however same as with burst healing this is often a last resort. When running Virtues,
  opening this Tome will also cleanse conditions.
